<h4>JAMINI ROY</h4>
<p>Jamini Roy (1887-1972)
    Jamini Roy's art celebrated the simplicity of everyday life and indigenous culture. His folk-inspired style, characterized by bold lines, flat colors, and simple compositions, resonated with the rustic charm of rural India. Works like "Three Pujarins," "Alpona Dancers," and "Mother and Child" invite you to appreciate the unsung heroes of rural life.</p>
    jamini Roy (1887-1972).Roy began his career as a commissioned portrait painter. Somewhat abruptly in the early 1920s, he gave up commissioned portrait painting in an effort to discover his own.[9]

    Roy changed style from his academic Western training and featured a new style based on Bengali folk traditions.[10]
    
    Roy is also described as an art machine because he produced 20,000 paintings in his lifetime which is about 10 paintings daily but made sure his artistic aims remained the same.[11] He always targeted to the ordinary middle class as the upholder of art however he was thronged by the rich. Keeping his respect to the middle class reflected on his critical views; he believed that ordinary people were more important than governments because they were the voice of his art.[12]
    
    His underlying quest was threefold: to capture the essence of simplicity embodied in the life of the folk people; to make art accessible to a wider section of people; and to give Indian art its own identity.
    
    He also used indigenous materials like lamp black, organic tempera, earth and mineral pigments to paint.
